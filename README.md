- 👋 Hi, I’m @PriestieBeast
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about softeware development and coding. I am at the very beginning of my journey, and have thus far only meddled with linux OS and Raspberry Pi. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the different courses on GitHub, trying to get the gist of the site. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular, but i will contribute where i can. 

Have a nice one - Cheers
